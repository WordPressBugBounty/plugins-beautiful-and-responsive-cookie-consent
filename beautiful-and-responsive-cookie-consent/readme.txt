- **nsc_bar_cs_done** -> set if you activate ITP Protection (use backend cookies). Stores the information of when the cookie was set, to give them a duration.
  = Localstorage is used =

= Credits =
This really beautiful plugin wraps the solution provided by osano (https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/download/) into a wordpress plugin.
This Version uses 3.1.0 from osano as basis, but it has a lot modifications to the original source code. It is optimized for performance and for a low database impact.

= NOTE: Using this plugin alone does not make your site automatically compliant. As each website and country is different you must make sure you have the right configurations in place. Google tag manager can help you with that for free. =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why backend cookies? (ITP >= 2.1) =
Most Cookie Banner plugins set javascript cookies. In Safari and Firefox these cookies have a short lifetime, even if the cookie is set with an very long expiration date.
**Consequence:** Your user have to opt in every seven days again. And sees the banner every seven days. Which is kind of annoying.
With this Plugin the consent cookie stays save and is not limited in lifetime. If you use the option.

= How to remove tab at the bottom? =
Just go to Settings > Cookie Consent Banner > Consent Management and uncheck the checkbox "Show 'Cookie Settings' tab"

= Does this plugin have a setting for blocking scripts or cookies until acceptance? =
Yes. With the premium add-on ([beautiful-cookie-banner.com](https://beautiful-cookie-banner.com/)) you can enable autoblocking. But be aware: there is no 100% guarantee that this will always work. As this is heavily dependent from your wordpress installation.

= How should I organize my trackingscripts and cookies? =
The technical recommandation is to use the google tag manager. It is an awesome and free tagmanager. Since version 2.2 this plugin natively supports it. But as always: check if it is legal to use it in your jurisdication☝️.

= I have a custom template and want to modify the cookie message. How? =
You can use the filter hook "nsc_bar_cookie_bar_message" in your plugin or theme.

== Screenshots ==

1. Cookie Banner Mobile Example - two buttons.
2. Cookie Banner admin settings area with banner example.
3. Set the colors and general appearence of the Cookie Banner.
4. Set the text and customize the links of the Cookie Banner.
5. How should the Cookie Banner behave? Two Buttons, one button? Consent categories? Everything is possible.
6. Define how user can interact with the Cookie Baner after they closed it? Only per shortcode link? Or a tab?
7. Block scripts which set cookies automatically with the premium add-on of this cookie banner.
8. Basic cookie settings. The consents are stored in a cookie.
9. You can easily import and export most of the settings of your cookie banner. Very handy to apply it to multiple pages.
10. Mobile Example of the cookie banner.
11. Mobile Example of the cookie banner.
